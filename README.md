This project is based on Chatgpt prompts where through prompts we obtain skeleton code of HTML,CSS and JavaScript for tic-tac-toe game.
Later this codes are tweaked for better result and using CodePen we could understand the places where the code needs to be amended for better result.
As we have the final code now we create a webpage for using it through tiinyhost portal.
Later this code is combined to apk to use as an app via WebIntoApp portal.
